Role Overview

As the Lead Technical Writer, you will play a pivotal role in transforming highly technical engineering, product, and operational content into clear, structured, and user-focused documentation. You will guide a team of writers (or freelancers), collaborate closely with cross-functional stakeholders (engineering, operations, QA, regulatory), and own the content strategy for documentation across the business including technical manuals, procedures, training materials, and API / software documentation.


Key Responsibilities

Work with engineering, systems integration, flight operations, regulatory, and safety teams to gather detailed technical information, verify accuracy, and ensure compliance.

Design content strategy for documentation, setting standards, templates, and style guides to ensure clarity, consistency, and usability.

Analyze existing documentation and user feedback to continually improve documentation quality, user experience, and content delivery.

Create user-friendly training materials (written, visual, possibly interactive) to support internal teams (operations, maintenance) and external stakeholders (customers, partners).

Plan and manage documentation projects set timelines, estimate resource needs, and coordinate with product and engineering roadmaps.

Ensure documentation meets relevant regulatory, quality, and safety standards (e.g., aerospace documentation, QA, compliance).

Experience producing deliverables like user manuals, maintenance guides, procedures, training materials.

Understanding of regulatory or quality compliance in aerospace or similar industries is a big plus.

Excellent project management and organizational skills.

Attention to detail, strong analytical mindset, and ability to adapt quickly to evolving product changes.
