## 🎯 ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Compliance

### ATS-Friendly Formatting
✅ **DO**:
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Use standard section headings (PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION)
- Include keywords from job description
- Use bullet points, not tables
- Save as .docx or .pdf

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use headers/footers
- Use text boxes or columns
- Use images or graphics
- Use unusual fonts or symbols
- Use acronyms without spelling out first

### Keyword Optimization
1. Read job description carefully
2. Identify 10-15 key skills/requirements
3. Naturally incorporate into bullets
4. Don't keyword stuff
5. Use industry-standard terms

---

## 🔍 DANS (Digital Application Navigation System) Compliance

### Requirements
✅ Document metadata (author, title, keywords)  
✅ Heading 1 style for name  
✅ Heading 2 style for section titles  
✅ Standard page size (8.5" × 11")  
✅ Standard margins (0.75")  
✅ Uppercase section titles  
✅ Explicit colors (black for body text)  

**Why it matters**: DANS-compliant resumes are easier for digital systems to parse and index, improving searchability in databases.
