## Tips for Best Results

### Be Honest

Answer based on what you truly want, not what you think you "should" want. Authentic responses lead to better matches.

### Think Long-Term

Consider where you want to be in 2-3 years, not just your next immediate role.

### Consider Trade-offs

No role is perfect. Think about what you're willing to compromise on vs. non-negotiables.

### Multiple Profiles

You might take the interview multiple times with different mindsets:
- "Dream job" profile - Ideal scenario
- "Pragmatic" profile - What's realistic right now
- "Pivot" profile - Exploring career changes

### Update Regularly

Your preferences change! Retake every 6-12 months or when:
- You've gained new skills

- You're considering a career change
- You've had experiences that changed your perspective
